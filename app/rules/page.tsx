                Welcome to the eleventh annual Montgomery Blair Math Tournament,
                or MBMT XI for short! MBMT is a free middle school math contest
                that seeks to inspire students&apos; interest in mathematics and
                to encourage them to explore math beyond the school curriculum.
                Contest details can be found on the{" "}

                    For fractional answers whose numerator and denominator are
