                MBMT consists of four rounds: Individual Round, Team Round, Guts
                Round, and Fun Round. Both the Abel (lower) and Jacobi (upper)
                divisions will take Individual Subject Tests (of which students
                take two subjects among Algebra, Geometry, Counting and
                Probability, and Number Theory). Each Individual Subject Test
                consists of eight questions and lasts thirty minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Team Round has fifteen questions for all team members to
                collaboratively solve in forty-five minutes. The Guts Round is
                an hour-long round that is graded live and requires team members
                to work together on progressively harder five-problem sets, each
                of which is worth more points than the previous set. The Fun
                Round is an exciting round consisting of several separate
                mini-events, including puzzles, trivia, and an estimation round.
            </p>
            <p>
                After hosting the tournament for several years, we have worked
                hard to calibrate the accessibility and difficulty of problems
                in both divisions. Our guiding philosophy is that every
                participant in MBMT should find the rounds approachable yet
                challenging.
            </p>
            <p>
                Individual and team winners in each division will receive medals
                or trophies! Team scores are calculated using Team and Guts
                Round scores, combined with a weighted average of individual
                scores, and teams with the highest scores in each division win.
                The individual awards are for high-scoring individuals overall
                and in each subject test. There are also additional awards for
                high performance on the Guts Round. Finally, we will also
                recognize the highest-scoring 6th-grade student in the {lower}{" "}
                Division.
